We are looking for the shift $\epsilon$ of the ball such that
$A_\epsilon := \mathcal{B}_\rho( (0,\epsilon) ) \cap X$ has an area of exactly
half the area of $\mathcal{B}_\rho(\cdot)$. Since we are assuming that the
boundary of $X$ at point $P$ has locally a curvature of $k$, then
$\rho \ll 1/k$ implies that the boundary is well approximated by a
parabola $f(x):=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ in the frame centered on $P$ and oriented
toward inside $X$ in the direction of the normal vector.

It follows that the optimal value $\epsilon$ is non negative and
obviously may not exceed $\frac{1}{2}k\rho^2$. Note that $\epsilon <
\frac{1}{4}k\rho^2$ is also quite natural.

Let $A''=(-\rho,\epsilon)$, $A'=(-\rho,f(-\rho)+\epsilon)$, and let
$A$ be the intersection of the parabola $f$ with the disk
$\mathcal{B}_\rho( (0,\epsilon) )$.

Let us bound $|x_A -x_{A''}|$. Since $0 \le \epsilon \le
\frac{1}{2}k\rho^2$, it is easily seen that $|x_A -x_{A''}|$ is
maximal when $\epsilon=0$.
Let $A^3$ be the intersection of the horizontal straight line coming from $A'$ with the disk $\mathcal{B}_\rho((0,0))$.

Obviously, $|x_A -x_{A''}| \le |x_{A^3} -x_{A''}|$. 
Let $d:=y_{A'}-y_{A''}$. Since $A^3$ belongs to the disk, we have
$|x_{A^3} -x_{A''}| = \rho-\sqrt{\rho^2 - d^2} \approx \frac{1}{2\rho}{d^2}$.
For $\epsilon=0$, $d=\frac{1}{2}k\rho^2$.
Putting all together,
\begin{align*}
  |x_A -x_{A''}| \le |x_{A^3} -x_{A''}| 
  \approx \frac{1}{2\rho}{\left(\frac{1}{2}k\rho^2\right)^2}
  = \frac{1}{8}k^2 \rho^3.
\end{align*}
